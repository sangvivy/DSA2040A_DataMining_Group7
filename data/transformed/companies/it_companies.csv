Anyone can SAY this, it is a completely different thing to PROVE it…We have been doing this for over 20 years, and we PROVE it every day.

We are unlike any other vendor you have worked with before.  We are abundantly sure that you have had this happen…a vendor tells you ‘oh my goodness, this is the best candidate you will ever talk to ever…’.  Then you talk to the candidate and find out it is nowhere near what you were seeking.  Does this sound familiar?  If it does, you should contact us.

Don't just take our word for it, here is what our customers say about us: link:  https://rsmsolutionsinc.com/services/our-customers/

- I focus on the right 'fit' for roles, from both a technical fit AND a social fit.
- I actually know what a good BI person, .net developer, DevOps, and ERP specialist should look like.
- 95% of our time is actually spent 'customer-facing'...meaning we speak, primarily, to C, VP and Director level IT Execs...we KNOW what you need and how to get it.
- I have accèss to every resume on Indeed.
- I write my own job descriptions for every role we work on.
- I will offer information what the market is really saying in terms of what is realistically available as opposed to BS'ing our way through things.  This includes salary information on real live data.  I do not charge for this, it is part of what I do.
- For many many years, I have not charged placement fees for Director, VP and C level roles...I have example resumes of what is getting placed, can help with effective networking, and can offer all kinds of help...all for the sake of 'good karma' (in other words, no fees).",1.0,Florida,US,Naples,34119,3115 Santorini Ct,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rsm-solutions-inc

We respect, trust, and care for our employees.  We have worked hard to build a company that inspires an intense emotional attachment to the business. We are a close-knit organization where team members spend time together, experience significant and important events together, and know what is going on in each others’ lives.

We spread the money around. There is not a huge disparity between the lowest and highest paid people in the company. We offer the best health insurance that money can buy, fully paid for you and 80% paid for your dependents. 

Our hope is that employees love what they do, enjoy the people with whom they work, get compensated appropriately, and have time for other passions in their lives. Not everybody wants to work for the rest of their life. And nobody wants to worry about money, especially in their later stages of life. So, we are striving to create a company that allows people to stop working while they are still relatively young and healthy and have some kind of nest egg to carry them forward.

Agileana is a lean, agile, web development firm in the DC metro area holding a GSA IT Schedule 70 and 18F Agile BPA. We are aligned with the USDS Playbook. Our core competencies include enterprise-level Drupal, user centered design (UCD), DevOps, Section 508, and open source technologies.

We practice Lean Startup to deliver Minimum Viable Products (MVP) using Continuous Integration (CI) and Test Driven Development (TDD). We focus on Getting Stuff Done (GSD). We provide digital services using modern technical stacks and DevOps techniques that embrace continuous integration and continuous deployment. We deliver secure and tested mobile and web application designs using automated testing frameworks.

10393438,"SubcoDevs, Inc [Software Product Engineering] 🚀 Looking for Results? Let's talk!","How can you reduce guesswork in your software product development strategy?

Do you know if your team going to deliver the results? 

Or, 

Are they going to put your reputation at stake?

Are you: 
⁉️ Frustrated with moving delivery dates?

⁉️ Concerned that your team doesn't seem to ask you right questions?

⁉️ Worried that you can't rely on your team to deliver specific results?


Let’s be honest, a lot of software projects continue to be shelved (read 'fail') because of numerous reasons.

Both you and your development team TOGETHER make a project successful. It’s the collaboration. It’s the teamwork. And most importantly, a step by step process or a system for you & your team to attain PREDICTABLE OUTCOMES during the product development journey. 


There are things you and your team could do to minimize risks and avoid failure. I help identify possible bottlenecks such as:

✅ Communication: It's important to build a cadence for communication between and among stakeholders.

✅ Team or Leadership Issues: Think of alignment issues in a vehicle. Is your team aligned with your product goals?

✅ Delays in Delivery: Is the project really delayed or expectation is not being managed between 'what-your-team-could-humanely-deliver' vs 'a rush to deliver the project yesterday'? 


I can help deliver the results you have envisioned for your software projects. Some of the feedback from Clients: 

“Great communication and delivered results that met and/or exceeded the project requirements.”

""Great experience, communication, execution. Very helpful. Subodh explained my options and was an advocate to what is best for me. Did not take advantage of me as a customer without much knowledge.""


Let’s strike a conversation and I will help remove the bottlenecks.
