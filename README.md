## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA focuses on understanding the structure, quality, and trends in IT job postings. Key steps include:

Data Overview:

-Load and inspect the processed_it_jobs.csv dataset
-Check dataset shape, columns, and sample records
-Identify missing values and duplicates
-Basic Statistics
-Total job postings
-Unique companies and job titles
-Date range of job postings
-Domain & Experience Analysis
-Distribution of IT job domains (e.g., Data Science, DevOps, Cloud)
-Required experience levels per domain
-Visualization: Bar charts showing domain and experience distributions
-Work Type & Remote Opportunities
-Analyze work types (Full-time, Contract, Internship)
-Identify remote vs on-site opportunities

Skill Demand

Count mentions of top IT skills in job titles & descriptions

Visualization: Top 15 in-demand skills in a horizontal bar chart

Temporal Trends

Track job postings over time (monthly trends)

Compare growth in top IT domains using line plots
